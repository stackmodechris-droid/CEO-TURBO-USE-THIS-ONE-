        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          {SITE.name} ({SITE.url}) is operated from {SITE.address.streetAddress}, {SITE.address.addressLocality}, {SITE.address.addressRegion} {SITE.address.postalCode}, USA. This policy explains what personal information we collect and how we use it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-foreground">Free audit:</strong> when you run the free visibility audit, we collect your name, email, phone number, business or artist name, city, website and your answers, and we store the results of the audit. <strong className="text-foreground">Ordering review cards:</strong> when you order, we (or our checkout provider) collect your name, email, phone, shipping address and business name; payment details go directly to the payment processor and we never see your full card number. <strong className="text-foreground">Booking a call:</strong> our scheduling provider Cal.com collects your name, email, the time you choose and any notes you add. <strong className="text-foreground">Browsing:</strong> our host and any analytics we enable may log standard technical data such as IP address, browser, device and pages visited.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <p>To send and explain your audit, follow up about it, hold your call, fulfil your order, reply to you, prevent fraud and improve the site. If you're a client, we use your information to deliver the work you've hired us for. We do not sell or rent your personal information.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Calls and text messages</h2>
        <p>If you give us your phone number, we may call you about your audit, order or inquiry. We only send text messages if you tick the box agreeing to them. Message and data rates may apply; message frequency varies. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP for help. Agreeing to texts is never a condition of buying anything. We don't share your phone number or text-message consent with third parties for their marketing.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Who we share it with</h2>
        <p>Service providers that run parts of our business — scheduling (Cal.com), payments and checkout (Stripe), website hosting (Vercel), the spreadsheet or CRM tool where we keep leads, card fulfilment partners (only your shipping details), and advertising or analytics platforms if enabled — only as needed to provide their service. We may disclose information if required by law.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Public data used by the audit</h2>
        <p>To build your report, the audit loads the public website you enter and looks up the business or artist name in public sources (Wikidata, Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, OpenStreetMap and, when available, Google PageSpeed Insights). We only send those services the name, city or website you entered — never your contact details.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cookies and embedded content</h2>
        <p>The booking calendar is embedded from Cal.com and may set its own cookies when you open it. We use analytics and advertising tags to measure visits and ad performance: Google Analytics and Google Ads, Meta Pixel, Microsoft Advertising (UET) and TikTok. They may set cookies and send events such as page views, button clicks, phone taps and form submissions to those platforms. We also use Microsoft Clarity, which records how visitors move around the site (clicks, scrolling and page visits) to improve it. Clarity masks form fields, so names, emails and phone numbers you type are not recorded. You can block or delete cookies in your browser settings, or use a browser ad-blocker to stop these tags.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
        <p>We keep booking and client records for as long as needed to provide services and meet legal, tax and accounting obligations, then delete or anonymize them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can ask to access, correct or delete your personal information, or opt out of marketing emails at any time using the unsubscribe link. California residents have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know, delete, correct and opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information; we do not sell personal information. If you are in the EU or UK, you also have rights under the GDPR, including objection, restriction and portability, and you may complain to your local data protection authority.
