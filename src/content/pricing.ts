// happening (security, updates, SEO/AEO/GEO, tracking health, ads, email). The à-la-carte setups below are
// for people who only need one thing — and they anchor how much a package saves. Ad spend is always paid by

  { q: "How much does CEO Turbo cost?", a: `Most clients pick one setup package and one monthly plan. Packages: Turbo Start ${price("pkg-start")}, Turbo Launch (the whole package, with a new website) ${price("pkg-launch")}, Turbo Dominate ${price("pkg-dominate")}. Monthly plans: Turbo Care ${price("care")}/mo, Turbo Growth ${price("growth")}/mo (includes ads management), Turbo Scale ${price("scale")}/mo. Need just one thing? Google Business Profile setup is ${price("gbp-setup")} and websites start at ${price("site-artist")}.` },
  { q: "What's in the whole package?", a: `Turbo Launch (${price("pkg-launch")} one-time) is everything a business or artist needs to get found and get customers: a new website built for SEO, AEO and GEO; Google and Bing indexing so you show up on Google, Microsoft Bing, ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity; Google Business Profile; up to 5 social profiles; Merchant Center for stores; GA4, Tag Manager, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok and Reddit tracking; an email system; your own booking calendar; ad campaigns on your 2 best-fit platforms; and 2 NFC review cards. Your first month of Turbo Care is free.` },
  { q: "What are Conversion Rescue and Tracking Watch?", a: `Conversion Rescue (${price("conversion-rescue")} one-time) audits and fixes everything your ads depend on: GA4, Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Clarity, Meta Pixel and Conversions API, Google Ads and Microsoft conversions, with real conversion values and a wasted-spend fix list. It's included in every setup package. Tracking Watch (${price("tracking-watch")}/mo) keeps it healthy and trims wasted spend each month; Turbo Care, Growth and Scale already include it. Ads & tracking setup (${price("tracking-setup")}) is for brand-new accounts with nothing to repair.` },
  { q: "Why is there a setup fee and a monthly fee?", a: "Setup is the one-time work of building something properly — a website, a Google profile, tracking, ad campaigns. Monthly plans are for things that need constant work to keep paying off: security and software updates, the latest SEO and AI search changes, tag and pixel health, ad optimization and email campaigns." },
  { q: "Is there a contract?", a: PRICING_TERMS.contract },
  { q: "Is ad spend included?", a: PRICING_TERMS.adSpend + " Most local businesses start with $10–$20 a day." },
  { q: "Do I need a monthly plan after setup?", a: `We strongly recommend Turbo Care (${price("care")}/mo). Websites need security patches, software updates, backups and tracking checks to stay safe and keep ranking — and search and AI change every month. Care covers all of that plus an email campaign and Google posts.` },
  { q: "How do you compare to other agencies?", a: `Most small-business agencies quote thousands for a website alone, then charge separately for SEO, ads management and maintenance. Turbo Launch includes the website, SEO/AEO/GEO, tracking, profiles, email and ad setup for ${price("pkg-launch")} one-time, and Turbo Growth (${price("growth")}/mo) includes ads management, content and care — no contract.` },
  { q: "Is SEO, AEO and GEO worth it for a small business?", a: `If one new customer is worth $300 to you, Turbo Growth (${price("growth")}/mo) pays for itself with two extra customers a month — and unlike ads, rankings keep bringing customers after you've earned them. ${PRICING_TERMS.results}` },
  { q: "Who owns the website and accounts?", a: PRICING_TERMS.ownership },
  { q: "Can I start small?", a: `Yes. Turbo Start (${price("pkg-start")}) fixes your Google profile, socials, indexing and tracking without a new website. Or start with a few review cards, see the results, then add more. Book a free Brand Boost call and we'll tell you the one thing to start with.` },
