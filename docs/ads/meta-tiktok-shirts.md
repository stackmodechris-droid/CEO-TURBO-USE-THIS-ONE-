# Meta (Facebook + Instagram) and TikTok ads — custom shirts

Two products, two audiences:

- **Artist merch** → https://www.ceoturbo.com/artist-merch: independent artists, rappers, bands, DJs, producers.
- **Company shirts** → https://www.ceoturbo.com/custom-company-t-shirts: small-business owners, mostly trades, restaurants, salons, gyms and cleaners.

Nothing here is live. Every campaign is built **paused**, and you turn it on.

## TikTok or Meta — which is cheaper?

| | TikTok | Meta (FB + IG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost per 1,000 views (2026) | ~$4–9 | ~$8–14 |
| Cost per click | ~$0.20–1.00 | ~$0.50–1.50 |
| Cost per **sale** | usually higher | usually **lower** (better buyer data) |
| Best for | artists (they live there), cheap reach, funny videos | business owners, retargeting, actually closing the sale |

**Plan:** use TikTok to get eyeballs cheaply, use Meta to get purchases, and **retarget everyone who designed a shirt but didn't buy** on both. The `customize_product` and `begin_checkout` events already fire on both pixels, so those audiences fill themselves.

## The videos

These live in `ads/hyperframes/`. `npm run ads:build` writes them and `npm run ads:render` renders them to `ads/hyperframes/out/*.mp4`, at 1080 × 1920 and about 15 seconds each. Edit the words in `ads/hyperframes/build.mjs` and re-render; each ad is a list of scenes.

| File | Audience | Hook (first 2 seconds) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artist-merch-guy.mp4` | Artists | "POV: your merch guy said 'next week'" — sticker: 6 weeks ago |
| `artist-zero-merch.mp4` | Artists | "Me at my own show selling 0 merch" |
| `artist-tour-back.mp4` | Artists | "My tour: 3 cities" — sticker: 2 are my cousin's house |
| `biz-group-project.mp4` | Business | "Your crew showing up to a job like a group project". Six mismatched shirts snap into matching logo shirts |
| `biz-minimum-24.mp4` | Business | Print shop: "minimum is 24 shirts", then "Me with 3 employees" |
| `biz-new-hire.mp4` | Business | "New hire showing up in a Minions tee, day 1" |

Every ad ends on the price, "no minimum", free shipping and the URL. Add a trending sound inside TikTok or Meta when you upload: the videos are silent on purpose, so you can pick the sound that's trending that week. **Turn captions on.**

## Tracking (already wired)

| Event | Meta | TikTok |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page view of a shirt page | ViewContent | ViewContent |
| Uploads art or edits the design | CustomizeProduct | CustomizeProduct |
| Taps Order | AddToCart, then InitiateCheckout | AddToCart, then InitiateCheckout |
| Pays | Purchase (Shopify **Facebook & Instagram** app) | CompletePayment (Shopify **TikTok** app) |

Before TikTok can work:

1. Install the **TikTok** sales channel on Shopify. This connects the pixel and sends purchases.
2. Copy the pixel ID into Vercel as `VITE_TIKTOK_PIXEL_ID`.
3. Generate an Events API token and put it in Vercel as `TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The steps are in `docs/tracking-setup.md`.
4. Redeploy.

## TikTok setup (TikTok Ads Manager)

  - Creators: follows hip-hop, R&B and indie music creators.

  - CTA: **Shop now**.
- **URLs:** same pages, with `utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=artist_merch|company_shirts&utm_content=__CID_NAME__`. TikTok also appends `ttclid`, which the site already passes to Shopify checkout.
- **Spark ads (do this):** post the videos on the CEO Turbo TikTok and Instagram accounts too, then boost the posts as Spark Ads / Partnership ads. They pick up likes and comments, which keeps CPM lower.

## Kill / scale rules (check every 3 days, never sooner)

| Signal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ad spent 3× its target cost per sale with **0 purchases** | Turn that **ad** off, not the campaign |
| Hook rate (3-second views ÷ impressions) under 25% on TikTok, or thumb-stop under 20% on Meta | The first 2 seconds aren't working. Change the hook line in `build.mjs` and re-render |
| CTR under 0.8% | Change the offer line or the first scene |
| Cost per purchase under **$15** (company) / **$12** (artist) | Raise the budget 20% every 3 days |
| Average order of 6+ shirts | You can afford up to about $40 a sale — scale harder |

**Break-even:** one shirt makes about $10–12 before ads (`docs/company-shirts.md`). A 1-shirt order can only afford about $10 in ads; a 12-shirt order can afford about $100. That's why the copy pushes "12+ / 24+ / 50+". Watch the **average order size** in Shopify Analytics.

## Organic (free) — post the same videos

Post one video a day on TikTok, Reels and YouTube Shorts from the CEO Turbo accounts. Rotate the 6, then remake the winners with new hooks. In the comments, pin: "Design yours → ceoturbo.com/artist-merch".
