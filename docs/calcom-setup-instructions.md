## Step 7: Test the Booking Flow

   - Verify all questions appear correctly
   - Check confirmation email is sent
   - Verify redirect to `/booked` page works

2. **Test Tracking:**
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab

## Step 8: Get Embed URL

Once the event is created:

3. **Copy the embed URL** (looks like: `https://cal.com/your-username/home-office-setup`)
4. **Add to website** - The existing booking component will use this URL

---

## Step 9: Integration with Website

**Update Booking Component:**
The website's existing booking system will automatically use the new event type. You may need to:

1. **Update the booking URL** in the service page component
2. **Add the event slug** to the booking configuration
3. **Test the embed** on the `/services/home-office-setup` page

**Code Integration:**
```tsx
// In the service page or booking component
const bookingUrl = "https://cal.com/your-username/home-office-setup";
```

---

## Step 10: Set Up Notifications

**Email Notifications:**
- **To you:** Enable immediate email notification for new bookings
- **To customer:** Enable confirmation email (default)
- **Reminder:** Enable 24-hour reminder email

**SMS Notifications (Optional):**
- Enable SMS reminders if you have SMS credits
- Send reminder 2 hours before consultation

**Calendar Integration:**
- Connect to Google Calendar
- Connect to Outlook/Office 365
- This prevents double-booking

---

## Step 11: Configure Team Members (If Applicable)

If you have multiple technicians:

1. **Add team members** to Cal.com
2. **Assign event type** to specific team members
3. **Set round-robin** or priority assignment
4. **Each member sets their own availability**

---

## Step 12: Analytics & Reporting

**Track These Metrics:**

- No-show rate
- Average lead time from booking to consultation
- Conversion rate from consultation to paid job

**Cal.com Analytics:**
- Built-in dashboard shows booking trends
- Export data for custom analysis

---

## Troubleshooting

---

## Next Steps After Setup

3. **Monitor first few bookings** to ensure everything works
4. **Adjust availability** based on demand
