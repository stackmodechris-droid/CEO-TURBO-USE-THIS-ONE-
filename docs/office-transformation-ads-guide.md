## MICROSOFT ADS (BING)

### Strategy
Microsoft Ads (Bing) typically has lower competition and CPC than Google Ads. Use similar strategy to Google Ads but with Bing-specific optimizations.

### Keyword Strategy
Import high-performing keywords from Google Ads after testing. Bing users tend to be older and more business-focused, so emphasize:
- Professional services
- Business transformation
- Enterprise-grade solutions

### Ad Copy Templates
Use Google Ads templates but adjust character limits for Bing (slightly different limits).

### Location Targeting
Same as Google Ads: Georgia state with priority on major cities.

### Budget Recommendations
- **Starting budget:** $20-40/day
- **CPC expectations:** $2-5 (typically lower than Google)
- **Import strategy:** Import campaigns from Google Ads after optimization

### Conversion Tracking Setup
- **UET tag:** Ensure UET tag is firing on all pages
- **Custom events:** Track phone clicks and booking confirmations
- **Goal setup:** Create conversion goals for phone calls and form submissions
