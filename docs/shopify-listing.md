# Shopify listing — NFC Google Review Card

Paste these fields into the **existing** product (Products → *Google Review Tap Cards – NFC + QR Review Cards*, id `15410641502443`).
Keep editing that one product rather than making a new one, because the website's buy box is wired to this product id.

> **Required for checkout to work:** the **Pack** option and its 3 variants (section 5). Until they exist, the site's
> Buy button safely falls back to the order-request form instead of sending people to a checkout with the wrong price.

## 3. Media (upload in this order, with this alt text)
Files are in `public/img/review-cards/`. Shopify accepts the `.webp` and `.jpg` files as they are.

| # | File | Alt text |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `feed-white.jpg` | NFC Google review card, white Review Us On Google front and black NFC back |
| 2 | `specs.webp` | Review card specs: NTAG215 chip, waterproof PVC, 85.5 × 54 × 0.76 mm |
| 3 | `retail-counter.webp` | Customer taps the Google review card at a store counter after paying |
| 4 | `tap-review.webp` | Phone held near the card opens the Google review page — iPhone and Android |
| 5 | `how-it-works.webp` | How it works: tap phone, open review link, submit feedback |
| 6 | `stack.webp` | Stack of Review Us On Google NFC cards |
| 7 | `size.webp` | Credit-card size: 85.5 mm × 54 mm |

Delete the old blue NFC + QR images from the product.

## 4. Category, organization
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Business & Industrial › Signage *(if Shopify suggests a closer "NFC tags / business cards" category, that's fine too)* |
| Product type | `NFC Review Card` |
| Vendor | `CEO Turbo` |
| Collections | Create **Google Review Cards** and add it |
| Tags | `google review card, nfc review card, tap to review, review us on google, google reviews, nfc card, small business, restaurant, salon, barber, contractor` |
| Status | Active |
| Theme template | Default product |

## 5. Variants — option name **Pack**
Click **Add options like size or color** → Option name **`Pack`** → values exactly **`1 card`**, **`2 cards`**, **`5 cards`**.
Then delete the old "Default Title" variant if Shopify keeps it.

| Pack | Price | Compare-at | Cost per item | SKU | Barcode | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 card | **24.99** | *(leave blank)* | 7.00 | `CT-NFC-REVIEW-1` | *(blank)* | 1 oz |
| 2 cards | **39.99** | *(leave blank)* | 14.00 | `CT-NFC-REVIEW-2` | *(blank)* | 1.5 oz |
| 5 cards | **79.99** | *(leave blank)* | 35.00 | `CT-NFC-REVIEW-5` | *(blank)* | 2.5 oz |

- **The SKUs must match exactly.** They are the same ids the website, the Merchant feed and the ad pixels use, so purchases line up across Google, Microsoft and Meta.
- **Compare-at:** leave it blank. Showing a "was" price you never really charged is a fake discount (FTC and Merchant Center both flag it). The site already shows real pack savings.
- **Charge tax:** Yes.
- **Pack 1 → 2 → 5 margins** at $7 a card: about $18, $26 and $45 gross per order, before shipping and fees.

## 6. Inventory
- **Inventory tracked: Off.** Packs use different numbers of cards, so per-variant counts would be wrong. You have 30 cards; reorder when you hit about 10.
- If you'd rather track it: set 1-card = 30, 2-card = 15, 5-card = 6, and adjust by hand after each order.

## 7. Shipping
- **Physical product:** On.
- **Package:** a 6 × 9 in bubble mailer (add it under Settings → Shipping → Packages). A rigid card in a plain letter envelope gets a non-machinable surcharge and can get bent.
- **Settings → Shipping and delivery:** create a "Free US shipping" rate at **$0.00** for the United States. Processing time: 1–2 business days.
- **Country of origin:** CN *(from your supplier)*. **HS code:** `8523.52` (smart cards).

## 8. Search engine listing (pencil icon)
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Page title | `NFC Google Review Card – Tap to Review | CEO Turbo` |
| Meta description | `Customers tap their phone and your Google review form opens. iPhone & Android, no app, no subscription. From $24.99, free US shipping.` |
| URL handle | `nfc-google-review-card` |

## 9. Store settings that affect conversion (do these once)
1. **Settings → General → Store name:** change "My Store" to **CEO Turbo**. Buyers see this name on the checkout page and in receipts.
2. **Settings → Checkout → Customize:** upload the CEO Turbo logo, use the brand colors (button `#ff6b1a`, accent `#1a9fff`), and turn on **Shop Pay, Apple Pay and Google Pay** under Settings → Payments.
3. **Checkout → Customer contact:** "Phone or email" plus **"Add a phone number field: Optional"**. The phone number improves ad matching.
4. **Order status page → Additional scripts:** leave it empty. Tracking runs through Customer events (see `tracking-setup.md`).
5. **Sales channels:** keep the product published to **Buy Button**, since the website's checkout uses that channel's token. The Online Store channel is optional.
6. **Policies:** add Refund, Shipping, Privacy and Terms policies (Settings → Policies). Merchant Center and Microsoft both require them.

## 10. Order notes you'll see
Every order placed through ceoturbo.com shows **Additional details** on the order: Business name, Pack, Landing page,
and the ad click ids (gclid / fbclid / msclkid, `_fbp`, `_fbc`) plus UTMs. That tells you which ad drove the sale.
