- This enables real-time tracking and CRM integration

Free 30-minute consultation to discuss your office transformation needs. We'll cover your space, equipment, timeline, and budget. Serving the entire state of Georgia.
```

**Button Text:**
- `Book Free Consultation`

```
Your consultation is booked! We'll call you at the scheduled time at 470-502-9543. If you need to reschedule, use the link in your confirmation email.

**In the event description or confirmation page, add:**

## Step 7: Test the Booking Flow

1. **Test Booking:**

   - Verify all questions appear correctly
   - Check confirmation email is sent
   - Verify redirect to `/booked` page works

2. **Test Tracking:**

3. **Copy the embed URL** (looks like: `https://cal.com/your-username/office-transformation-consultation`)
4. **Note:** Office transformation uses direct phone/text CTAs, not Cal.com embed, but the event type is needed for tracking consistency

---

1. **Add team members** to Cal.com
2. **Assign event type** to specific team members
3. **Set round-robin** or priority assignment
4. **Each member sets their own availability**

---

## Step 11: Analytics & Reporting

**Track These Metrics:**

- No-show rate
- Average lead time from booking to consultation
- Conversion rate from consultation to paid project
- Average project value by region

**Cal.com Analytics:**

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Tracking not firing**
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Test booking with DevTools Network tab open
- Verify dataLayer pushes are happening

**Issue: Questions not appearing**
- Ensure all questions are marked as "Enabled"
- Check question order (drag to reorder)
- Test in preview mode before publishing

**Issue: Double bookings**
- Check buffer time is set
- Verify calendar sync is working
- Ensure team member availability is correct

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Test full booking flow** from website to confirmation
2. **Monitor first few bookings** to ensure everything works
3. **Adjust availability** based on demand
4. **Create ad campaigns** pointing to the service page
5. **Track conversion metrics** from ads to bookings

## Ad Campaign Integration

When creating Google/Microsoft/Meta ads:

**Landing Page:** `/services/office-transformation`
**Call to Action:** "Call for Free Quote" or "Text for Quote"
